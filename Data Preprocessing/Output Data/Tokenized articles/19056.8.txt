artificial

the

artificial

then

intelligent

the

found
studying
intelligent

intelligent

found
standing

yes
humans

intelligent

thus
1900s
researchers
began
exploring

reasoning
process
humans
human
beings
considered
ideal
intelligent
agent
mimicking
human
behavior
aim
initial
years
research
after
setting

studies
experiments
began
famous

conducted
initial
years
achieve
aim
turing
test
turing
defined
intelligent
behavior
ability
achieve
human-level
performance
cognitive

sufficient
fool

but

received
criticism
mimicking

intelligence
because
intelligence
working
human

thus
mimicking

transformed

the

so
basically
initial

human-centered
humans
considered

concurrently
field
computer
science
developing
a

with

computer

this

ultimate
intelligence
a

program
this
leads
a
question
human
intelligence
ideal
intelligence
as
computers
advanced
proved
humans
complex
tasks
that
ability
solve
cognitive
tasks
problems
so
nature
agents
researchers
began
study
nature
intelligence
then
question
test
validate
intelligence
the
test
intelligence
solve
cognitive
problems
an
agent
intelligent
solve
a
complex
problem
the
problem-solving
approach
easily
tested
validated
computers
thus
researchers
began
studying
ideal
intelligence
selected
agent
validate
experiments
computer
so
a
computer
problem-solving
approach
adopted
so
human-centered
approach
computer
problem-solving
approach
main
aims
both
fields
contributed
field
giving
valuable

both
aims
important
collaboratively
form
main
aim
machine
learning
in
problem-solving
approach
a
big
challenge
overcome
order
achieve
aim
consider
solving
a
math
problem
there
cases
intelligence
tested
problem-solving
approach
let
math
problems
solve
the
problem
familiar
problem
consider

the
problem
familiar
means
solve
kind
problems
solved
similar

past
so
a

the

this
form
intelligence
consider

a

problems
past
then
solve

consciously
gather
manipulate

reach
a
conclusion
this

approach
necessarily
rely
past
data
completely
reasoning
process
this
kind
intelligence
for

but

learn
past
data
find

today
reached
a

that
type
intelligence
so
implement

intelligence
machine

so
